# divided_differences
My implementation of Newton's Divided Differences method.

In this program, I use information inputted from the user either by comand line or via test-based file to build a divided differences table. After doing this, I utilize the information from the table to build polynomials in Newton's form and Lagrange's form. After that, I finish by simplifying this polynomial.
